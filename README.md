# 🔍 AI Tool Recommender Agent

This repository contains an AI-powered agent that helps users discover similar tech tools based on a natural language query.

When a user enters a query (e.g., "alternatives to Notion" or "tools like Zapier"), the agent:

1. Uses **Firecrawl** to search the web and retrieve top results.
2. Processes and filters relevant tools from those results.
3. Recommends a list of similar tools based on the original query intent.
